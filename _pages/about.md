My journey began in mathematics, exploring problems that have now led me to the fascinating world of stock market trading algorithms. I am drawn to challenges with simple, clear statements, where the true work lies in discovering the path to a solution.
 
This adventurous trip through various analysis methods—from candlestick charts to finding hidden patterns with machine learning and statistical models—has taught me a crucial lesson: the market is neither a pure phenomenon nor a simple game. Instead, it is a complex game governed by the rules of underlying phenomena.
 
I enjoy sharing my experiences and insights on my blog and would be glad to hear your ideas.
